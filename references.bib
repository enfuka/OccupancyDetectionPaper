  abstract   = {Physical therapy exercises are critically important for the rehabilitation of patients with motor deficits. While these exercises can be most effective when performed properly under the supervision of a physical therapist, it may not be a viable option for all patients. Thus, there is a growing trend towards at-home physical rehabilitation tracking systems as they can be more accessible and flexible for patients. However, existing systems mostly depend on camera and wearable based solutions, which can be costly and limited. To this end, we propose a low-cost and non-intrusive end-to-end solution using IoT-based wireless sensing devices. Our solution, Wi-PT-Hand, leverages Channel State Information (CSI) captured from ambient WiFi signals and uses Bayesian optimizers and a hierarchical deep learning model trained to recognize the prescribed hand exercises. The proposed system includes (i) segmentation of the therapy time into activity and non-activity durations, (ii) recognition of the exercise performed in an activity segment, and (iii) counting of the number of repetitions of the exercise performed within that segment. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and performs well in various real life scenarios, and thanks to the lightweight design it can work on low-resource edge devices properly.},

  abstract  = {The building energy saving (BES) has been the subject of extensive research for reducing the energy consumption inside the buildings. One of the key solution for energy saving in buildings is to minimize the energy supply to the building areas that are not occupied by the inhabitants. However, this requires effective monitoring of occupants regardless of unpredictable variations in indoor environment, such as variation in the space size, furniture arrangement, nature of occupant's activity (e.g., varied intensities and instances) etc. Currently, various occupancy monitory solutions have been employed in the existing smart buildings, namely PIR sensors, CO2 sensors, cameras, etc. However, they are costly and sometimes not interoperable to the complex variations in indoor environments. In this paper, we leveraged the fine-grained information of physical layer (i.e., channel state information - CSI) of the commodity WiFi for occupancy detection and developed a self-adoptive method which is interoperable with complex variations in the indoor environment. In indoor contexts of different sized, varied intensities of physical activity, and various instances of activity of daily living (ADL), our testbed evaluation showed an average detection rate of 98.9\%, 98.5\%, and 98.1\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) is a novel way of environmental sensing and human activity recognition (HAR). These methods can be used for several safety and security applications by (re)using Wi-Fi routers without the need for additional costly hardware required for vision-based approaches, known also to be particularly privacy-intrusive. This work introduces a full pipeline of a Wi-Fi CSI-based system for human activity recognition that assesses and compares two deep learning methods. We analyze how different hardware configurations affect WiFi CSI signals. We contribute a novel and more realistic data collection process, in which human activity recognition is seamlessly integrated in real-life, resulting in more reliable assessments of the model classification performance. We analyze how InceptionTime and LSTM-based classification models perform in human activity recognition. The source code and collected dataset are made publicly available for reproducibility and encouraging further research in the community.}

  abstract = {Along with the development of society and the country, the development of cities also occurs. People use technology to facilitate the work of the community. Some of them are the Internet of Things (IoT). This technical concept solves some of the issues like traffic system, parking lots, and operating electronic devices at home when the user is away. The Internet of things provides wireless access to this system and allows users to maintain one-track parking space availability in the crowded area and on the busy lanes, with the increase in Vehicle population, road congestion in big cities is one of the major consequences. The system majorly focuses on the concept of a parking space detection mechanism that uses sensors in combination with the use of Internet of Things. i.e., it sends parking status to the internet web page. This allows users to see which parking spaces are free and where to park. This is achieved by sending the sensor's data to an IoT platform via the ESP8266 WiFi module, which displays data using HTTP. These types of systems make the user find parking slots easier than creating a mess this process saves the user time as well as improves the easy being by tracking the charges of the vehicle.}

  abstract  = {Searching for parking spots generates frustration and pollution. To address these parking problems, we present PocketParker, a crowdsourcing system using smartphones to predict parking lot availability. PocketParker is an example of a subset of crowdsourcing we call pocketsourcing. Pocketsourcing applications require no explicit user input or additional infrastructure, running effectively without the phone leaving the user's pocket. PocketParker detects arrivals and departures by leveraging existing activity recognition algorithms. Detected events are used to maintain per-lot availability models and respond to queries. By estimating the number of drivers not using PocketParker, a small fraction of drivers can generate accurate predictions. Our evaluation shows that PocketParker quickly and correctly detects parking events and is robust to the presence of hidden drivers. Camera monitoring of several parking lots as 105 PocketParker users generated 10;827 events over 45 days shows that PocketParker was able to correctly predict lot availability 94\% of the time.},
