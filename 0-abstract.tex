\textit{This paper presents a novel, low-cost approach to accurately detecting empty parking slots using wireless sensing techniques and channel state information (CSI) data. Existing solutions either rely on dedicated sensors for each parking spot, which increases deployment costs, or estimate the total number of available spaces without pinpointing their exact locations. In contrast, our approach leverages CSI-based wireless sensing to achieve accurate, real-time detection of individual empty parking slots while maintaining cost efficiency. By utilizing CSI data, our method enables robust and reliable parking slot detection even in dynamic environments. This scalable and easily deployable solution aims to improve smart parking systems, optimizing urban mobility and parking efficiency.}
